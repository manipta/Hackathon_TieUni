## Inspiration
Our Inspiration comes from the personal experience of one of our team members. He is very fond of IOT Hobby Kits even before entering college. He struggles a lot to learn on his own. The fact that IOT kits are costly is also a barrier. So, to help such ambitious Learners who can't afford or find any relevant resources we thought to help them.

## What it does
We provide subscription-based STEM kits. There are three types of kits: Beginner level, Intermediate level, and Advanced level. It also includes video tutorials for the same. We are having three dedicated plans each for Educational Institue, Individual and Rental Service.

## Individual:
There are currently 3 subscriptions in individual plans from which Learner can choose.

(i) Annual Plan (To be paid Annually)

(ii) Annual Plan (To be paid Monthly)

(iii) Monthly Plan (To be paid Monthly)

Here, the cost of each kit would be different for each plan. ( (i)<(ii)<(iii) )

## Educational Institute:
There will be plans depending on the requirements of the school/institute. if the requirement is not fit or is too large then the institute can directly contact us.

## Rent a Kit:
For Renting a kit, Learner can search their nearby Linked CybercafÃ©s.

We will also host competitions for the showcase and the refinement of the Learner's skills acquired by using our kits.

## How we built it
We made a website for getting subscriptions and Learner's reviews.

For this, We implemented the design idea first using various wireframes. Then we made UI/UX design. Using Flowcharts, we described the features and flow of the website.

After, having a clear idea of what we had to develop, We started with the Development phase.

for this we are using the following technologies:

1. HTML5

2. CSS3

3. JS

4. Balsamiq

## Challenges we ran into
We faced many challenges throughout the process. Firstly, during the brainstorming of ideas, there were some conflicting ideas between team members. Then some difficulties occur in the designing phase like searching for innovative ideas. But at the end we convinced each other and resolved the issues and moved on.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment we have achieved is that we have found various innovative ways to get access to expensive STEM kits at an affordable price without sacrificing the quality of the kits.

This is done by the Rental service.

## What we learned
There are so many things that we have learned while developing this solution. We've got to know about different technologies and frameworks that previously we were unaware of. We have also learned various aspects of designing a website from scratch.

## What's next for SarvHetu
We have so many plans for SarvHetu. like we currently there are only 3 different levels of kits. In the future, we want to add an expert level also. In this, a learner can customize and make their personalized kits by selecting the specific components that they require. We also want to add a dashboard feature for educators/teachers in Institute Plan so that they can check the progress of each learner enrolled in it.
